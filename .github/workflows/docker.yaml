#Note:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Working directory between different containers 
#share same volume mounts on host machine
#so any changes in workdir of any container is accessible by other containers
#Networks are also shared
#You can also sue custom entrypoint scripts 
#just give them execute permissions first
